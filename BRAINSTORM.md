# Documentation of Brainstorm Process

### Objective
To design a solution for personalized clinical trial recruitment messaging that addresses user concerns, sentiments, and privacy, ultimately increasing engagement and participation in clinical trials.

### Brainstorm Process

1. **Identify Core Problem Areas**
   - **Awareness**: Many potential participants lack awareness or have misconceptions about clinical trials.
   - **Trust**: Clinical trials often evoke concerns about safety, privacy, and purpose, especially among general audiences.
   - **Motivation**: Users may not feel a personal benefit from participating in clinical trials, leading to low motivation to engage.

2. **Key Opportunities**
   - **Personalized Messaging**: Use sentiment and background analysis to create targeted, user-centered messages.
   - **Privacy & Sensitivity**: Address privacy concerns by anonymizing data and using language that builds trust.
   - **User Support & Information**: Provide resources to inform users, helping them feel confident about participation.

3. **Questions and Hypotheses**
   - **How does sentiment-based messaging impact clinical trial engagement?**
   - **Which types of users are most likely to respond positively to recruitment messages?**
   - **Can user concerns be effectively addressed through personalized messaging?**
